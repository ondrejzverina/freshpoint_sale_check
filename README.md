# Freshpoint sale checker
This is basic script for checking which items are in sale and keeping that information so one item is not displayed more than once. It is displayd just in case the price is even lower. 

## Usage:
Before running the script create virtual enviroment and to that install required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in root of the repository. Than you can run it with `python main.py` in src folder.
